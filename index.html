		<h2> About me </h2>

		<hr>

		<img src="assets/images/me1.png">
		<p>I was born and raised in NYC, as a kid I was always into technology and video games. When I was a kid I remembered playing the Nintendo console when it was first was introduced to the US. Playing Duck Hunt was my favorite Nintendo past time. In my teen year's I became fascinated with online PC gaming.  I had gotten deeply emerged into the MMORPG/FPS world of PC gaming. I began wanting to learn more about computer's in order to run my games smoothly. I started learning the aspects of how a computer works from the hardware side of it; Molding processes, RAM, hard drives, video cards and sound cards. I began using programs to overclock CPU and GPU processors in order to achieve maximum performance on my video gaming experience. In turn, I have decided to switch career fields from health care to technology to gain more knowledge and possibly enjoy something similar to a life long hobby, which is web development. </p>
